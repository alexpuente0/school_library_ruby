# School Library

In this project, we are creating a school library app using OOP, a tool to record what books are in the library and who borrows them. This app allows you to:

- Add new students or teachers.
- Add new books.
- Save records of who borrowed a given book and when.
- Keep it all in a beautiful and well-organized way!
